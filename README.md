Map simplified by uniform sampling and marching squares. The result should look geometric with only vertical, horizontal, and 45-degree (and 135-degree) lines. Still a work in progress.

The input is a TIFF file converted from an SVG file, quantized (or color-indexed), and scaled down to remove anti-alias artifacts. For example, this is an converted map of the United States.

Here is one for Thailand.
